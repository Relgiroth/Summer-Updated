                <p style="text-align: left;">Summer is the ideal time to embrace outdoor activities that offer a break from routine. Take advantage of the 
                    sunshine and fresh air by organizing activities like basketball, soccer, or even a game of frisbee at a nearby park or court. All you need 
                    are some basic sports equipment and a group of enthusiastic participants. </p>
                <p style="text-align: left;">To spice things up, introduce variations such as playing with handicaps like using only one hand in basketball, 
                creating makeshift goals in soccer, or playing ultimate frisbee with a twist where points are doubled for trick shots. Outdoor activities not only 
                promote physical fitness but also foster teamwork, friendly competition, and a chance to enjoy the outdoors while making the most of the summer days.</p>
